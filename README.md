# valladopy
Python implementation of algorithms/examples/problems presented in David A. Vallado's "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications"; presently the 5th edition (2020).

Python Implementation Goals:
1) Build a set of tested tools to develope orbital missions.
2) Automate patched conic methods.
3) Explore astronomy related calculations.

See full list of references in the file references.py.\
Also examples/solutions H.D. Curtis book, and Braeunig's orbital mechanics on-line http://www.braeunig.us/space/interpl.htm .\
Implemented with python 3.11+ and pip install in a virtual environment.

So far (2024-10-11) the required addons are NumPy and Matplotlib.
